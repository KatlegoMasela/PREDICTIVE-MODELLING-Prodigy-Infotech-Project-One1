House Prices Prediction

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. 

The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. 

The model helps estimate property values and gain insights into price-influencing factors.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Steps Followed**
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and encoded categorical data.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

Model Training:
Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Trained a Linear Regression model to predict prices.

Evaluation:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 989,968,234,326.68
R-squared (RÂ²): 0.029
